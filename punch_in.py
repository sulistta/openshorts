"""Punch-in: a short push toward the subject on the beats that carry the clip.

Not a layout. Every other mode here decides WHERE the frame sits; this one
decides when it moves in, which is the difference between a clip that reads as
footage and one that reads as edited. A static crop for 45 seconds is the single
most "unedited" thing a vertical clip can do.

The push is deliberately small. Anything past ~15% starts cropping the speaker's
head on a face-framed shot, and on an upscaled source it also starts showing.
The curve is asymmetric on purpose: fast in, hold, slow out, which is how a
human operator does it and how it reads as intent rather than drift.

It rides the TRACK path, widening the existing per-frame crop command from
x-only to w/h/x/y, so it composes with the camera trajectory instead of fighting
it. Off by default (``PUNCH_IN=1``).

Beat times come from the audio envelope. The transcript would be a better
source (punch on the hook word, not on the loudest syllable), and render() has
no transcript today — ``emphasis_times`` is a plain list of seconds, so wiring
main.py's word timings in later needs no change here.
