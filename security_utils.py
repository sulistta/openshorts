"""Small, dependency-free SSRF guards shared by the download / scrape paths.

The app fetches user-supplied URLs server-side (yt-dlp downloads, SaaS landing
page scraping, actor-image download). Without a guard, a caller can point those
at internal services or link-local metadata endpoints to read instance
credentials. ``assert_public_url`` rejects non-HTTP(S) schemes and any
host that resolves to a private / loopback / link-local / reserved address.
