"""SPLIT layout: two speakers stacked one above the other in the 9:16 frame.

The third layout, next to TRACK (crop to one face) and GENERAL (blurred
background). It exists for the one case both of the others handle badly: two
people sharing a wide shot and talking to each other. TRACK picks one of them
and throws away the reaction, which is usually where the hook is; GENERAL keeps
both but shrinks them to a strip floating in blur.

Stacking gives each speaker a half-frame crop, so a 1920x1080 source feeds each
half a 1215x1080 region that scales DOWN to 1080x960. No upscaling, unlike the
single-face crop of a 720p source.

Gated off by default (``SPLIT_LAYOUT=1`` to enable): a wrong SPLIT is a worse
failure than a wrong TRACK, because half the frame is then a person who never
moves.
